# 10Key-MechKeeb
-this is the code to my 10 key, mechanical keypad
+look for more info on how to use this code in my video or https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/usb/keyboard/ (arduino's official keyboard library reference)

+you can set your own special key (not letters) with any modifier from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/KeyboardModifiers and set letters using Keyboard.print("") command

+any letter or word you put in there (make sure to include quotations) will print on your screen when it is executed (key is pressed), including all capitalizations 
(if your keybind is shift sensitive, capitalization could ruin it)
